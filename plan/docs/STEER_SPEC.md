# SteerSpec

Canonical contract for a SteerLens workspace. Stored as `steertree.yaml` at the workspace root.

Executive UI never shows this document by default; Technical mode and git reviews do.

## Design rules

1. **Display names are enough for Slice 1** - external refs optional.
2. **Stable ids** (`out_…`, `bet_…`, `team_…`, `mem_…`) for diff-friendly edits.
3. **Provenance** on teams drives write-back policy later.
4. **No secrets** in SteerSpec.
5. Versioned with `apiVersion` + `kind` for migrations.
6. **Team Topologies is canonical** for team types and interaction modes ([key concepts](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts)).

## Team Topologies in SteerSpec

| SteerSpec                           | Team Topologies                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `team.role: stream_aligned`         | Stream-aligned team                                |
| `team.role: platform`               | Platform team (may later be a _grouping_)          |
| `team.role: enabling`               | Enabling team                                      |
| `team.role: complicated_subsystem`  | Complicated-subsystem team                         |
| `relationship.mode: x_as_a_service` | X-as-a-Service                                     |
| `relationship.mode: collaboration`  | Collaboration (time-box later via `expectedUntil`) |
| `relationship.mode: facilitation`   | Facilitation                                       |

Legacy aliases (`customer_facing`, `shared_platform`, `coaching_support`, `uses_as_service`, `works_together`, `coaching`) are accepted on parse and normalized to the canonical ids above.

Optional `teams[].members[]` records display name, job `title`, and `ftePercent` (0–100) as a **capacity signal** — not an HR directory.
