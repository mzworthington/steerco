# SteerSpec

Canonical contract for a SteerLens workspace. Stored as `steertree.yaml` at the workspace root.

Executive UI never shows this document by default; Technical mode and git reviews do.

## Design rules

1. **Display names are enough for Slice 1** - external refs optional.
2. **Stable ids** (`out_…`, `bet_…`, `team_…`) for diff-friendly edits.
3. **Provenance** on teams drives write-back policy later.
4. **No secrets** in SteerSpec.
5. Versioned with `apiVersion` + `kind` for migrations.

## JSON Schema

Machine-readable schema: [`../schemas/steertree.schema.json`](../schemas/steertree.schema.json)

Sample: [`../samples/steertree.sample.yaml`](../samples/steertree.sample.yaml)

## Mismatch rules (core)

| Code | When |
|------|------|
| `bet_without_team` | Bet has empty `fundedTeamIds` |
| `bet_without_kill_criteria` | Missing kill criteria |
| `platform_overload` | Shared platform has dependents above threshold (default 8) |
| `team_without_bet` | Customer-facing team funds zero bets (warning) |
| `orphan_outcome` | Outcome with zero bets |

## Mapping to foreign shapes (later)

| Foreign | Direction | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Backstage `Group` | In | Map to `teams[]` + `externalRefs`; set `provenance` |
| Backstage Group YAML | Out | **Only** if `provenance: catalog_file` and user opts in |
| SteerBet overlay | Out | Always OK - SteerLens-owned kind |
| GitHub team | In | `externalRefs: [{ system: github, id: org/team }]` |
| Entra group | In | `externalRefs: [{ system: entra, id: objectId }]` |
| ArchLens entityRef | Out/In | Optional `bets[].systemRefs[]` (field reserved, unused Slice 1) |
