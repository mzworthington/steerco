# SteerLens

**Investment alignment for engineering leaders** — a board-pack you can interact with.

SteerLens helps Engineering Directors and non-technical executives keep **strategy, team shape, and evidence** aligned — and decide what to start, stop, or continue. It is intentionally **not** Jira, not an org directory, and not a service catalog.

| Related                               | Role                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SteerLens**                         | Bets, outcomes, topology _intent_, decision notes              |
| **[ArchLens](https://archlens.dev)**  | Systems architecture risk (separate product & visual language) |
| **Jira / Backstage / Entra / GitHub** | Systems of record SteerLens _references_ (never replaces)      |

This folder holds **product planning** (specs, PRDs, schema, samples). Implementation lives under `app/`; accepted architecture decisions live under [`docs/ADRs/`](../docs/ADRs/).

## ADRs

Canonical ADRs: [`docs/ADRs/`](../docs/ADRs/) (tech stack, local-first, suite relationship, provider write-back, hosting).

## Slice 1 (committed direction)

- **Local only** — open a folder, edit SteerSpec, export a board pack
- **No authentication**
- **Executive visual language** (light, editorial) — technical import/merge comes later behind a secondary surface
- Auth and live connectors (Backstage / GitHub / Entra) land in **Slice 2+**

## One-liner

> Jira plans work. Backstage catalogs systems. Entra catalogs people. SteerLens contracts how strategy, team shape, and evidence stay aligned — and when to stop.
